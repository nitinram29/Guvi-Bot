<p>Let’s dive right in.&nbsp;</p>





<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is a Full Stack Developer?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A full stack developer is a type of software engineer who can work with both the front-end and the back-end of web applications. &nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="740" height="740" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2.png" alt="full stack developer" class="wp-image-16332" style="width:514px;height:514px" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2.png 740w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-300x300.png 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-150x150.png 150w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-96x96.png 96w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></figure></div>


<p>They have expertise in all layers of the web development process, from the user-interface design right down to the database layer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Full stack developers are in high demand for their ability to develop a complete web application from start to finish. They are experts at quickly creating, testing, and deploying web applications. &nbsp;</p>



<p>They are highly&nbsp;capable individuals that can work&nbsp;with a variety of different technologies, from server-side languages and frameworks to front-end technologies such as <a href="https://www.guvi.in/courses/web-development/modern-html-css/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HTML</a>, <a href="https://www.guvi.in/courses/web-development/modern-html-css/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CSS</a>, and JavaScript.&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="1">

</ol>



<ol start="2">

</ol>



<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Server-side Frameworks</strong> &#8211; Server-side frameworks such as Express, Rails, or Django are also very important. They are used to create the back-end logic that powers web applications.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Version Control</strong> &#8211; Version control systems such as <a href="https://www.guvi.in/courses/it-and-software/git/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Git</a> or Subversion are also important. They are used to track changes in the source&nbsp;code and make it easier to collaborate with other developers.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Shortest&nbsp;Path to Become a Full-Stack Developer</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Now that you have a better understanding of what a full-stack developer is and the skills and technologies needed to be one, it’s time to discuss the fastest route to becoming a full-stack developer.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Find a Full Stack Developer Internship/Job.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Once you have built your&nbsp;portfolio, you can start to look for full stack developer internships and jobs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>You can search for jobs on job boards such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and Monster, or by directly approaching companies with your resume and portfolio.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>If you have joined a boot camp, then they assist you in landing a great job by screening and improving your resume and portfolio, training you through mock interviews, and sending your resume across major companies using their pool of connections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also important to network with other developers. Networking is a great way to learn about job openings and make connections. You must&nbsp;join online communities such as Slack or Facebook groups and attend local meetups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let us take a look at some of the main reasons why businesses are using Java software development for Machine Learning and Data Science in 2022.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Scalable Machine Learning Applications&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Java is used by most designers for developing applications that they can later scale as and when directed by business prerequisites. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When an organization is conducting a ground-up form for an application; Java&nbsp;is a great choice as it offers the opportunity to increasingly scale the&nbsp;highlights along with load balancing choices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hence, data researchers have concluded&nbsp;that developing complex applications in Java and scaling them is not only simple but also effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Java web development services have more than 45 billion Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) around the world that greatly leverage and simplify the scaling process.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Data Science-Friendly Syntax&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Java has a great linguistic structure that has been acknowledged widely for its simplicity and ease of understanding. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Java is specific, meaning every data type is predefined with the construction of the language, and most factors are supposed to be of the&nbsp;‘piece of a certain information’ type.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well-established organizations tend to keep a standard grammar tone for their code. Doing this guarantees that all designers code&nbsp;according to the organization&#8217;s standards. Java assists them by naturally keeping up with its own standard shows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Java delivers multiple data science methods such as data processing, data analysis, data visualization as well as statistical analysis that&nbsp;assist with applying machine learning algorithms to real-world business applications and products.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Faster Execution&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Compared to Python, Java is quicker.&nbsp;Java is statistically typed and compiled whereas Python is dynamically typed and interpreted. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This basically means that Java performs type check whilst compilation whereas Python performs it at run-time thereby increasing its&nbsp;execution time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to releasing Java solutions, this programming language has an extra edge over others. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As it saves a lot of time,&nbsp;Java developers&nbsp;choose to employ it for data science applications as it delivers high performance without compromising on efficiency.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you’re here, then you already understand what a huge grasp data scientists have in the tech world now and how important of a role they play for all kinds of organizations and businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the latest reports, in 2019 the global data science market was valued at $49 billion USD, more than double its worth in 2015. And, from 2022 to 2024, the market is projected to grow at a rate of about 30% each year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hence this comes as no shock that data scientist salaries in India range from Rs. 4L to Rs.20L/annum with an average of&nbsp; Rs. 9.4L/annum according to Glassdoor.</p>



<p>In order to completely understand neural networks and how they help you as a data scientist, we must first dive into deep learning.</p>





<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Data Science and Deep Learning</h2>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/best-way-to-learn-data-science/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.guvi.in/blog/best-way-to-learn-data-science/">Data Science </a></strong>at its base has always been about incorporating the best-suited tools to get a particular job done. It simply means the extraction of knowledge from some data to answer a specific question.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="575" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1.png" alt="data science" class="wp-image-15678" style="width:393px;height:294px" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1.png 768w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-300x225.png 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-150x112.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>


<p>Data science is a powerful asset that allows certain stakeholders and businesses to make informed decisions and create solutions to real-world problems using data.</p>



<p>It consists of collecting, storing, visualizing, processing, and modeling data so that we can draw meaningful insights and information from it. And data science makes use of several subject matters to make sense of the collected data, such as data analytics and statistics, data mining, machine learning, and deep learning.</p>



<p>Deep learning stands as one of the most intuitive fields in today’s artificial intelligence research, with a varied range of applications from self-driving cars to natural language processing.</p>



<p>As a data scientist, you may often have to gather and process vast amounts of data as well as perform certain predictive analytics on the same. And to make tasks like these easy, skills such as deep learning and neural networks become necessary to withhold.</p>



<p>The supremacy of ‘Deep learning’ lies in its incredible ability to accurately train big data, making it an essential skill for data scientists.</p>



<p>Hence, it is necessary for data scientists to understand deep learning techniques such as neural networks and use them, especially when working with massive amounts of data.</p>



<p>Before moving forward, make sure you understand the basics of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning, including algorithms, data analysis, and model training.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What exactly is Deep Learning?</h2>



<p>Deep learning can be termed as an advancement to the more traditional ‘machine learning’, wherein artificial intelligence technologies handle big data.</p>



<p>Artificial neural networks run a set of algorithms that assist machines in learning to perform tasks that would usually require human intelligence to operate.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="960" height="640" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15688" style="width:576px;height:383px" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-8.png 960w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-8-300x200.png 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-8-768x512.png 768w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-8-150x100.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></figure></div>


<p>The human brain is trained to function adequately and smartly evolve to encounter different situations by the repetition of tasks and procedures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deep learning works similarly, wherein a deep learning algorithm is set to perform a particular task repeatedly so that it can learn the problem and improve the result.</p>



<p>With cascading advancements in the fields of AI, deep learning is taking over machine learning in every sector, and its increase in popularity is indisputable.</p>



<p>Now that you understand what Deep learning is, let us dive into Neural Networks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Neural Networks you must know as a data scientist</h2>



<p>Neural networks can be defined as rugged deep learning models that are capable of synthesizing huge amounts of data in merely a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neural networks (or NNs) have been inspired by biological neural networks. And whilst the principles are the same, the processes and the structures are very different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Neural Networks, the input is made to pass through an activation function along with weighted edges and the generated output may be passed through another activation function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of these activation functions are stacked up, and each of them is called a layer. Besides the input and output layers, there are multiple layers in the interiors of a neural network that are known as hidden layers.</p>



<p>Now, there are many different types of neural networks that make a lot of everyday tasks simpler from recommending songs or movies to buying groceries online. Let’s take a look at what will help you as a data scientist.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some of the Important Neural Network Skills:</h3>



<p><strong>1. Perceptron</strong></p>



<p>Perceptron is a very simple neural network structure. This neural network model is also known as a single-layer neural network and consists of only two layers:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Input Layer</li>



<li>The Output Layer</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="656" height="329" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15680" style="width:471px;height:236px" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2.png 656w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-300x150.png 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-150x75.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Perceptron</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Perceptron has no hidden layers. It takes an input and then calculates the weighted input for each node. And this weighted input is passed through the activation function in order to generate an output.</p>



<p><strong>Applications in data science:</strong></p>



<p>Perceptrons are generally used in linear and binary model classification. They are also crucial in the formation of multilayer perceptrons.</p>



<p><strong>2. Multi-layer Perceptron</strong></p>



<p>Multilayer perceptrons (or MLPs), also known as feedforward neural networks, are fully connected networks. Specifically, each neuron in any one layer is connected to all of the neurons in adjacent layers.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="720" height="398" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15681" style="width:477px;height:264px" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3.png 720w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-300x166.png 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-150x83.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Multi-layer Perceptron</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As a result, an MLP has higher processing power when compared to a perceptron. Nonetheless, this ‘full connectedness’ makes them evidently prone to overfitting data.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Applications in data science:</strong></p>



<p>MLPs are commonly used in data prediction systems, data compression for social networks, speech recognition and hand-written character recognition systems, and computer vision applications.</p>



<p><strong>3. Convolutional Neural Networks</strong></p>



<p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one of the most important types of neural networks in computer vision, having been inspired by the visual cortex of the eyes, they are mainly used for visual tasks such as object detection.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="720" height="390" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15682" style="width:503px;height:272px" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4.png 720w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-300x163.png 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-150x81.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Convolutional Neural Network using a filter</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>What sets a CNN apart from other neural networks, is its convolution layer. This layer performs the dot product, which is a component-wise multiplication followed by addition.</p>



<p>During the initial phases of a CNN, the filters are completely randomized and do not impart any useful results. With the use of a loss function, the filters are adjusted and after a set of multiple iterations, the network starts to improve and achieve its task.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Applications in data science:</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;CNN&#8217;s are widely used for tasks pertaining to the processing of pixel data and in the field of computer vision. Some of the applications include object recognition, detection of tumors in medical diagnosis, facial recognition, face detection, and handwritten letter recognition.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>4. Recurrent Neural Networks</strong></p>



<p>When we read a book, we can only understand it in connection with all of its chapters as a whole and not just on the basis of a single chapter. Likewise, similar to natural neural networks, machine learning models also need to understand a particular text by making use of the already-learned text.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="512" height="255" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15683" style="width:480px;height:239px" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-5.png 512w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-5-300x149.png 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-5-150x75.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Working of an RNN</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Traditionally, this is not possible as we cannot store a model’s previous stages. Nevertheless, Recurrent Neural Networks (or RNNs) are capable of doing this, making them crucial in the case of applications that function on past data.</p>



<p>RNNs are designed to interpret sequential or temporal information. They use the other existing data points in a particular sequence to improve their predictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is carried out by taking input and reusing the activations from the previous nodes or later nodes in the current sequence in order to influence the output.</p>



<p><strong>Applications in data science:</strong></p>



<p>RNNs are highly used in connected-sequence applications such as time series forecasting, predicting stock market fluctuations, signal processing, handwritten character recognition, music generation, and image captioning.</p>



<p><strong>5. Long Short-Term Memory Networks</strong></p>



<p>With RNNs, only the information from the most recent stages can be retained. But with language translation, much more retention is needed and this is where LSTM networks shine.</p>

<p>In order to learn long-term dependencies, we must equip our neural network with memorization power and LSTMs are a special case of RNNs capable of doing that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LSTMs have a similar chain-like structure as RNNs, but the repeating module structure is different. This structure helps the network to retain a much larger amount of the previous stage values.</p>



<p><strong>Applications in data science:</strong></p>



<p>LSTM networks are very powerful when it comes to language translation systems, but they have more prominent applications in data science that include sequence-to-sequence modeling tasks such as anomaly detection, text summarization, video classification, and speech recognition.</p>

<p><strong>The door to data science jobs pretty much remains locked for beginners with no experience, but locks always have keys. All you need to know is how to get this key and unlock that door to boundless career opportunities!</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is like the chicken and egg problem. Since most companies don’t offer a job without any prior experience, and you just can’t gain experience without a job. It’s like a loop but you do not have to remain stuck here!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experience stands as a major criterion in the job market today. All employers pursue experienced professionals and consider the ones with relevant experience as better candidates. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to fall out of this loop and carve out your career path in data science, you need to have a clear roadmap in mind. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This blog will entail information about the learning journey you need to embark on to become a data scientist followed by&nbsp;some tips to land your first data science job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are a data science enthusiast and wondering how to become a data scientist without any experience, here is your perfect resource for going about the ways.&nbsp;</p>





<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Firstly, is it even possible to become a data scientist with no experience?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>To answer simply,<strong> yes!</strong> It is absolutely possible to become a data scientist, even if you are just starting out and don’t have any industry experience. The question should be how is that so?&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="600" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-19.png" alt="data science" class="wp-image-15054" style="width:720px;height:480px" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-19.png 900w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-19-300x200.png 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-19-768x512.png 768w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-19-150x100.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure></div>


<p>One of the most important factors that make the data science job market relatively accessible for newcomers is the significant and rapid growth of&nbsp;new data and the scientists needed to work with it. In short, the data industry is booming.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>In 2019, the global data science market was valued at $49 billion USD, more than double its worth in 2015. And, from 2022 to 2024, the market is projected to grow at a rate of about 30% each year.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this constantly expanding data market means a wealth of job opportunities for data science professionals and currently, the demand is far outweighed by the supply.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>As per </strong><a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Salaries/data-scientist-salary-SRCH_KO0,14.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Glassdoor</strong></a><strong>, data scientist salaries in India range from Rs. 4L to Rs.24L/annum with an average of Rs. 10L/annum.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data-driven companies need to&nbsp;consistently&nbsp;outperform their competitors, and that means hiring data experts will be an increasing priority across all industries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In short: Data scientists are in high demand, thus placing newcomers in a great position. The jobs are available and as long as you have mastered and can demonstrate the relevant skills, there’s nothing to stop you from getting a foot in the door.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Qualifications would you need to be a Data Scientist?&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The general ‘degree’ approach:&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Well, the most obvious answer to the question, “How to make data science your career?” is “Get a degree.” If you are at a point in your life where you can do that, then you should go for it but not without weighing out all the pros and cons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that said, you require both theoretical understanding and practical skills to succeed in this field. So, it is imperative to have the necessary knowledge before entering the job market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whilst traditional degrees from universities provide you with a backbone to rely on, they mostly do not equip you with the latest tools and technologies necessary to actually land a job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They follow a tried and tested curriculum which is not always up to date and when compared with the financial and time investment they decree, the ROI is not great.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The ‘online bootcamp’ way:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The other and very popular way of garnering the necessary skills and getting your dream data science job is by investing your time and money in online courses and bootcamps/certifications.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="600" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-17.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15052" style="width:752px;height:501px" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-17.png 900w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-17-300x200.png 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-17-768x512.png 768w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-17-150x100.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure></div>


<p>It is better than having to invest years and a fortune in a university degree, the curriculum is constantly updated, you build a great portfolio with real-world projects and these bootcamps are job-oriented. </p>



<p>To hold a stable&nbsp;data science career, you will need to build a solid foundation in subjects like Statistics,&nbsp;Mathematics, and&nbsp;Probability. Following this, you won’t simply use existing frameworks blindly but will be able to recognize their limitations and their construction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will need to be able to code in languages like Python, SQL, and R while having knowledge about data structures and ML algorithms. Being able to visualize data using various techniques and methods is also a must-have skill.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>GUVI offers a great live online course where <a href="https://www.guvi.in/zen-class/data-science-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can start learning Data Science from scratch by industry experts.</a> This course consists of all the relevant subjects in one place and you get Placement Assistance along with an IIT-M certification as well! </strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to get a Data Science job with no experience? Top 3 Must-Dos:&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Now, you’ve gained the necessary&nbsp;knowledge, but you still don’t have anything to show for it as in no work that showcases your skills and this is never good for a job search.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, here are our tips on what you can do to start a career in data science with no experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Create a gripping resume&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A resume depicts&nbsp;your skills and the projects you’ve worked on. So, don’t just pick a template fill it up. You need to be careful and share only your most important achievements in as little as possible since employers make job offers based on your resume.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should consider taking the help of experts in creating a resume that lives up to your reputation. Nowadays, many online courses offer such assistance along with their courses.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Working on Industry-Specific projects&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Simply having a portfolio with projects that you completed as part of your studies will not be enough. You will need something out of the ordinary to stand out amongst hundreds of applicants. &nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="600" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-18.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15053" style="width:715px;height:476px" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-18.png 900w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-18-300x200.png 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-18-768x512.png 768w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-18-150x100.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>Tip: <a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/data-science-projects/" data-type="post" data-id="5636">Choose project topics</a> deeply related to the industry you want to work in.</strong> &nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are&nbsp;passionate about or desire a particular cause or job opportunity, you should use datasets or collect your own data regarding that field and use your skills to draw useful insights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This kind of effort displays that you are passionate and willing to go above and beyond with your work, and such effort is always appreciated.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Build an Impressive Portfolio&nbsp;</h3>



<p>How can you get a job in data science if you don’t have any work that depicts the capabilities you claim to have in your resume? The answer is simple, build a portfolio of projects. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This portfolio must consist of projects that best show your abilities to work as a data scientist and it should look professional.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You must also make sure to&nbsp;put your work on GitHub. Following this, hiring managers can easily open the link from your resume and have a look at your projects.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Concluding thoughts:</h2>



<p>The data market is constantly growing, and so is the demand for skilled data scientists. As a rookie in the industry, you have plenty of value to offer and that is not just&nbsp;despite&nbsp;your lack of experience, but in various ways, because of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, keep learning and improving your skills and portfolio in order to bag that dream job!&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.guvi.in/zen-class/data-science-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Are you driven enough to ace a high-paying career in Data Science?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>It is projected that full-stack development jobs are likely to grow by 22% over the next 10 years!</strong> With Computer Science and IT job opportunities constantly increasing, not just CS graduates but people from all kinds of educational backgrounds are ramping up for a career in this industry due to its versatility and growth trajectory.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>According to Glassdoor, salaries for Full Stack Development in India vary between Rs. 2.4 Lakhs to Rs. 21 Lakhs with an average annual salary of Rs.7.5 Lakhs. </strong></p>



<p>Ever since the kick-off of programming as a mainstream skill, the most widely known skill-building option has been to invest one’s time and money in a computer science (CS) degree program. </p>



<p>However owing to the evolution of online education, technical certifications provided by independent code schools often known as boot camps offer a much more efficient and affordable path into the programming world for everybody interested. Let’s dive in for a discussion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do I require a CS Degree to get a Full Stack Development job?</h2>



<p>Up until now, a degree has made all the difference in obtaining a high-paying job and being screened out directly without even an interview in most fields. But, with the reigns of technological and economic development within the grasp of start-ups, this fact has changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Successful developers-turned-entrepreneurs such as<strong> Steve Jobs, Bill Gates,</strong> and many others have proved that dropping out of college and following a more productive route that caters to their skills didn’t hinder their career progress in any way and it was actually way better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Students have thus begun to question the whole outlook on degrees being a necessity and if it is even sensible to burden themselves with years of student loan debt for degree programs that can’t even keep up with the ever-increasing pace of modern technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Owing to the <a href="https://entrackr.com/2022/08/the-rise-and-fall-of-edtech-startups-in-2022-entrackr-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rise of Tech-Ed platforms</a>, it has become quite certain that you don’t “need” a Computer Science degree to be a coder, developer, programmer, or software engineer in the most basic sense and that you can develop your skills and start a career in this field via other mediums as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, doubts such as, <strong>“How does a Computer Science Degree benefit me?”</strong> or <strong>“How would a Bootcamp certification in Full Stack Development be the better choice?”</strong> and <strong>“Whether there is a difference in career options for the two paths?”</strong> would arise in your mind and rightfully so.&nbsp;</p>



<p> It is imperative to know that you can do a lot with either background. But to help you weigh out the pros and cons and introduce you to a well-known and effective online resource that has helped many students not only learn but also achieve their dream jobs, keep following this article.</p>



<p>Before diving into the next section, ensure you&#8217;re solid on full-stack development essentials like front-end frameworks, back-end technologies, and database management. If you are looking for a detailed Full Stack Development career program, you can join <a href="https://www.guvi.in/zen-class/full-stack-development-course/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=do-full-stack-development-jobs-rely-on-cs-degrees"><strong>GUVI’s Full Stack Development Career Program</strong></a> with placement assistance. You will be able to master the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and build real-life projects.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Computer Science Degrees vs. Coding Bootcamp</strong>s</h2>



<ul>
<li>Computer science degree programs are typically three to four years long and teach everything varying from computer programming languages to information system theories. There is quite a lot of theory about the origins of CS and the innovators that laid down the building blocks of our technology today so that you can understand the basics and eventually the advanced level tech of today’s world.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1571" height="1178" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-12-edited.png" alt="Is CS degree required for full stack development" class="wp-image-14996" style="width:829px;height:undefinedpx" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-12-edited.png 1571w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-12-edited-300x225.png 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-12-edited-1200x900.png 1200w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-12-edited-768x576.png 768w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-12-edited-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-12-edited-150x112.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1571px) 100vw, 1571px" /></figure></div>


<ul>
<li>Degree programs can turn out to be a good investment, but what matter are your end goals. <strong>Traditional three- or four-year degree programs can cost anywhere from Rs. 2,00,000 to Rs. 9,00,000, so it is crucial to understand the return on your investment.</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>If your fundamental goal is to become a full stack developer, systems developer, web developer, or database administrator, <strong>a boot camp can help you learn all of the necessary skills in 12 to 18 weeks at the cost of no more (and sometimes less) than one semester of a computer science degree program.</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Don’t take it the wrong way: Coding boot camps are definitely not bare-bones, but ‘just-the-basics&#8217; educational institutions. They can impart practical computer science skills and training in high-demand programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, or PHP owing to their intensive curriculum with a complete focus on full-stack development. The most attractive aspect is that the boot camp experience is designed to equip the students with precisely what they need in order to succeed in the CS and IT job markets and actually get hired.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>These two educational models constitute one major difference besides their cost and curriculum in the form of the career services element provided by coding boot camps. All coding boot camps are results-oriented, which means that they focus on how quickly, at what company, and with what CTC their students get hired (whereas computer science degree programs are just focused on making sure that students complete the program without paying much attention to their next steps).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Hence, these boot camps offer dedicated career success staff that review your LinkedIn profile, resume, and project portfolio, carry out mock interviews, introduce you to top recruiters, impart their knowledge of the best practices needed for networking and navigating the interview process, and keep you motivated once you are finally on the job market. This focused personal attention is not really feasible for large-scale colleges and universities with class sizes of 500 or more.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Cybersecurity </strong>is an exponentially growing industry that is evolving to protect individuals &amp; organizations from increasing cyber-attacks. Recently, The <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>(AI) Industry is playing a vital role in cybersecurity, improving the efficiency of various organizations &amp; industries’ cybersecurity.</p>



<p>In the present-day scenario, AI &amp; ML algorithms are heavily in use to automate tasks/processes, crunch data, enhance cybersecurity, &amp; make decisions at a mind-blowing rapid speed. Now, anyone will arrive at a wondering state that AI might replace the cybersecurity industry. But, no! Surveys &amp; statistics show a different yet interesting story.</p>



<p>In the cybersecurity domain, It is imminent that AI will become indispensable to handle the threats. Also, the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in the market is expected to grow 23.6% from 2020 to 2027, predicting a reach of $46.3 billion by the end. However, the adoption of AI into cybersecurity isn’t risk-free. About 60% of the companies that imbibed AI have encountered cybersecurity risks generated by Artificial Intelligence. Here, in this case, to handle the cyber threats, the expertise of cyber warriors will again be the need of the hour. Clearly, we see that Cybersecurity &amp; AI make a mutual impact on each other, but that doesn’t actually diminish the opportunities in both domains.</p>



<p>Now, we can discuss another perspective here so that you’d understand the relationship between cybersecurity, artificial intelligence &amp; human intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Does Cybersecurity still have a dependency on Human Intelligence?</strong></h2>



<p>Though AI appears to do everything, it can’t do everything. Both Human Intelligence and artificial intelligence are two different sectors when it comes to performance in calculations. In general, human intelligence isn’t capable of performing a large number of calculations steadfastly. But, we race ahead by compensating in other aspects. Say, the features to explore, hypothesize, deduce, predict &amp; the ability to logically reason. Even under certain situations with inadequate data &amp; ambiguity, we could perform cognitive tasks in a better way than AI. Thus, our brains are the best simulators &amp; win with complex biological features over any fastest &amp; latest supercomputer.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity professionals have a logically reasoned &amp; intuitive approach to handling cyber threats. With a lot of anonymity &amp; ambiguity thrown by the cyber attackers, cyber experts evaluate the risks, make cognitive judgments &amp; make better decisions with human intelligence. Such human capabilities cannot be replicated by the currently evolved AI features.</p>



<p>As of now,&nbsp; AI technologies are capable of performing mathematical calculations at an exponential pace as compared to the human brain. Hence, this is the ultimate benefit for the cybersecurity domain where AI can augment the human brain to help bring solutions to cyber threats.</p>



<p><strong>Ultimately, we can come to a conclusion. With the growing cybercrimes, cyber threats &amp; black hacking</strong></p>



<p>If the question is about choosing a career, the focus should be on what kind of roles &amp; responsibilities the aspirant is interested in putting in an effort to become a professional.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are you someone who is interested in Cybersecurity &#8211;</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>Safeguarding the organization&#8217;s information systems &amp; its assets.</li>



<li>Identifying &amp; solving actual &amp; potential cyber threats.</li>



<li>Enjoys defining the access privileges, control structures, &amp; resource security.</li>



<li>Keeping the team &amp; users informed about threats or attacks by preparing performance reports &amp; communicating system status.</li>



<li>Debugging the security violations &amp; inefficiencies through frequent audits.</li>
</ul>



<p>(or)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are you someone who is interested in Artificial Intelligence &#8211;</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>Automating infrastructure for the <a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/best-data-science-courses-for-beginners/">Data Science</a> team</li>



<li>Coordinating between Business Analysts &amp; Data Scientists</li>



<li>Improving Machine Learning algorithms time-to-time</li>



<li>Test &amp; deploy Machine Learning models for meeting the business goals</li>



<li>Develop the most consumable products for users based on machine learning</li>



<li>Coordinating with multiple teams, both internally and externally</li>



<li>Boosting the process of statistical analysis &amp; interpreting the results for effective decision-making.</li>



<li>Making ML an integral part of website layouts, &amp; UX team to help deliver finished website layouts, further used by the s/w development team.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, making an informed decision is up to the aspirant. If improving business goals through AI automation skills then Artificial Intelligence is the one interesting career path for you. On the other hand, If cyber challenges &amp; ethical hacking skills fancy you towards an adventurous career then Cybersecurity is the right choice for you! And, this domain doesn’t necessarily require majors/degrees in the respective cybersecurity domain. Any beginner can start from scratch to learn the white-Hat warrior skills.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>How many of you are genuinely making your College Final Year Projects? Are you planning to make one? Or are you looking to buy your College Final Year Project?  If you are planning to take the easy route- buying the project, please stop! Because we have15 (+ bonus) reasons why you should not buy your project! But instead, struggle with them and complete it successfully.  So here we go with the reasons.</p>
<h2><strong>Top reasons why you should not buy College Final Year Projects!</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>You will lose out on strengthening your core skills (Most Important)</strong></h3>
<p>Whether you do your project in <a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/the-5-most-user-friendly-programming-languages/">C, C++, JAVA or Python, or Ruby</a>, if you do your project yourself, your skills in that language will definitely improve a lot.  You might ask, how much am I going to learn in the 1-year time frame.  However, look at it this way, what you currently know about programming languages is just 1%.  But if you do your project, your knowledge would be 5-10%.  And it is the most difficult phase in learning.  You strengthen your basics.</p>
<h3><strong>You will lose out on your first real learning</strong></h3>
<p>Trust me, your project is going to be your first real learning.  And it will be a stepping stone for your future career and projects.  On the other hand, if you choose to buy, you will miss out on this crucial thing called learning about <a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/project-ideas-for-college-students/">real software projects</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>You will miss out on the self-learning skills</strong></h3>
<p>There is a difference between learning and self-learning.  For every problem you face in your College Final Year project, you have to search for solutions.  You have to read the concepts from scratch. Thereupon, You have to take reference materials, etc.</p>
<h3><strong>You will lose out on planning skills if you decide to buy your college final year project</strong></h3>
<p>For doing the  College Final Year Projects, you have to plan.  And if you want to do it successfully you have to plan it well.  If you don’t do a project, you will lose this crucial skill</p>
<h3><strong>You will lose out on leadership skills</strong></h3>
<p>Maybe there is an opportunity to lead the team in your College Final Year Project.  That opportunity gets screwed when you choose to buy one.</p>
<h3><strong>You will lose out on Team working skills if you choose to buy your College Final Year Project</strong></h3>
<p>When we did our College final year project, we discussed a lot of stuff. And finally decided to split the task among each other.  And we had to distribute the work in such a way that strong members of the team provide support to the not-so-strong members of the team.  When the time comes, they return the favor.  All these decisions making aspects will be missed out if you choose to buy your College Final Year Projects.</p>
<h3><strong>You will lose out on the Requirements Gathering and Analysis Skills for the project</strong></h3>
<p>This is one critical skill that would be useful throughout your software development career.  At any stage of your career, your project starts with your requirements.</p>
<h3><strong>You will lose out on the adjustment and Flexibility skills</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes, you may not be happy with your team members and sometimes, your team members may not be happy about you.  But when it comes to the project, everyone adjusts so that the end result is not affected.  This crucial skill goes a long way in a professional career.</p>
<h3><strong>You will lose out on negotiation skills</strong></h3>
<p>Yeah, sometimes you need to negotiate. Maybe it is with the scope of the project with your Project Guide, Maybe it is with the modules that each person is going to develop, etc. But you need those skills in a professional environment. If you don’t learn it with your project team members, you would never learn in a professional setup.</p>
<h3><strong>You will be unemployable to be harsh on it!</strong></h3>
<p>If you do a project, which means that you know how a project really works, etc. It may be different from a professional setup, but it is always better to have learned cycling before trying to ride a bike.  Isn’t it?</p>
<h3><strong>You will fall behind in your career if you plan to purchase your college final year project</strong></h3>
<p>Every company expects you to be at your Stage 5 in project development. But you are at Stage 0 still, if you buy your college final year project. This implies that by the time you join the office, you are already lagging behind others who have done their projects.</p>
<h3><strong>You will miss out on critical documentation skills if you plan to purchase a project</strong></h3>
<p>Everyone at the college level hates documentation. Even Professionals hate it. But documentation is one skill which if done well, makes a difference in the way other people see your work.</p>
<h3><strong>You will fail to understand the importance of hard work if you just buy your college final year project</strong></h3>
<p>Everyone hates taking printouts for project reports. But you still have to do it. Similarly in professional life, sometimes, we have to do certain things we hate. But it is for the overall good of the project.</p>
<h3><strong>You will lose out on creating a finished software</strong></h3>
<p>Creating finished software is a skill that can only be experienced. The joy of finishing something is just great. Just try it, it would feel great.</p>
<h3><strong>You will lose out on improving your professional communication skills</strong></h3>
<p>You would need to prepare reports, presentations, attend vivas, talk to your guides. All these would help you improve your professional communication skills.</p>
<h3><strong>You will lose out on searching Google &amp; StackOverflow for results and research</strong></h3>
<p>No matter how much of an expert you are, in today’s complex software environment, you have to search in google or StackOverflow if you are stuck with something. The interesting thing is, Google or Stackoverflow doesn’t magically give the answers for all your complex questions. You need to ask the right questions, combine answers from multiple questions, etc. to form your final answer. If you choose to buy, you will miss out on all these skills which are crucial in today’s software development world.</p>
<h3><strong>You will lose out on working on deadlines</strong></h3>
<p>Wow… Deadlines.  We hate them.  Isn’t it? But deadlines drive us actually. We won’t finish that assignment if we don’t have a deadline.  Similarly, we won’t complete the project if we don’t have deadlines.  The thing is, you need to carefully plan your project and have frequent deadlines for small subtasks so that the overall project runs smoothly.</p>
<h3><strong>You will not know your strengths and weaknesses if you don&#8217;t create your college final year project from scratch</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, over a period of a year, you would begin to understand your strengths and weaknesses.  For example, when any student makes his/her project,  they understand what they are good at or what they lack in. You might be good at coding, good at problem-solving and research, good at leadership. On the contrary, you could be bad at setting deadlines, or bad at presenting ideas, etc.  In short, you will identify your strengths and weaknesses if you do your college final year project.</p>
