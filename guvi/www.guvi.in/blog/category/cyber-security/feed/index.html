<p>Have you ever wondered what hacking is all about? It&#8217;s a big deal in today&#8217;s tech-heavy world, and it can be both fascinating and scary. In this blog, we&#8217;re going to explore hacking in simple terms so that you can understand it better. We&#8217;ll look at the different kinds of hacking that exist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, there are hackers who try to steal your passwords and others who fight to protect your information. Some hackers even have strong beliefs and use their skills to support their causes. It&#8217;s a bit like a digital battlefield out there.</p>



<p>By the end of this blog, you&#8217;ll have a better understanding of what hacking is all about, why it matters, and how you can protect yourself in the digital world. So, let&#8217;s begin this journey to unravel the mysteries of hacking in a simple and understandable way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is Hacking?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ethical-hacking-1-1200x675.webp" alt="Ethical hacking" class="wp-image-30574" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ethical-hacking-1-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ethical-hacking-1-300x169.webp 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ethical-hacking-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ethical-hacking-1-150x84.webp 150w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ethical-hacking-1.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>Hacking is the practice of gaining unauthorized access to computer systems or networks, typically for the purpose of discovering, exploiting, or manipulating vulnerabilities. It involves manipulating or bypassing security measures to access data, control systems, or disrupt digital operations. Hacking has evolved significantly over time. </p>



<p>It initially emerged as a term related to clever and creative problem-solving. Early hackers were computer enthusiasts who explored and modified computer systems to better understand them. However, the term has since taken on a dual meaning, encompassing both <a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/skill-requirements-to-become-an-ethical-hacker/">ethical hackers</a> who improve <a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/difference-between-cybersecurity-and-ethical-hacking/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.guvi.in/blog/difference-between-cybersecurity-and-ethical-hacking/">cybersecurity</a> and malicious hackers who engage in criminal activities.</p>



<p>Additionally, if you want to begin with Ethical Hacking &amp; Cybersecurity through a self-paced course, try <strong><a href="https://www.guvi.in/courses/network-and-security/cyber-security-ethical-hacking-beginners/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=what-is-hacking">GUVI’s Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking &#8211; Beginner course</a></strong>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Historical Context: The Emergence of Hacking Culture</strong></h3>



<p>The hacking culture traces its roots to the 1950s and 1960s when computer technology was in its infancy. Early hackers were curious individuals who wanted to explore the limits of computer systems and software. They shared knowledge and hacks to make systems work more efficiently. </p>



<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, hacking culture expanded with the advent of personal computers and the internet. Hacking communities began forming, leading to both constructive contributions and malicious activities. This period saw the emergence of ethical hackers (white hats) who aimed to secure systems and malicious hackers (black hats) who sought personal gain or mischief.</p>



<p>Hacking has a complex history and has evolved from a creative exploration of technology to encompass both ethical and malicious activities. Understanding the ethical and legal implications of hacking is crucial in today&#8217;s digital landscape, where cybersecurity and privacy are paramount concerns.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Types of Hacking</strong></h2>



<p>Hacking is a diverse field, encompassing a wide range of activities with varying intentions and consequences. Here, we&#8217;ll delve into five distinct types of hacking, each characterized by its purpose and ethical considerations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Black Hat Hacking</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Black-hat-hacking-1200x675.webp" alt="Black hat hacking" class="wp-image-30575" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Black-hat-hacking-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Black-hat-hacking-300x169.webp 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Black-hat-hacking-768x432.webp 768w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Black-hat-hacking-150x84.webp 150w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Black-hat-hacking.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>Black hat hackers are the &#8220;bad guys&#8221; of the hacking world. They engage in hacking activities with malicious intent, aiming for personal gain or to cause harm. Their actions often involve stealing data, distributing malware, or conducting cyberattacks. The 2017 Equifax data breach is a notable case of black hat hacking. Hackers infiltrated Equifax&#8217;s systems, compromising the personal and financial data of millions of individuals for potential financial gain.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>White Hat Hacking</strong></h3>



<p>White hat hackers, on the other hand, are the &#8220;good guys.&#8221; They use their <a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/skill-requirements-to-become-an-ethical-hacker/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.guvi.in/blog/skill-requirements-to-become-an-ethical-hacker/">hacking skills</a> for ethical purposes, such as identifying vulnerabilities in systems and improving security. These individuals are often employed by organizations to test and enhance their cybersecurity measures. </p>



<p>The company Bugcrowd runs a platform where white hat hackers can responsibly disclose vulnerabilities they find in various organizations&#8217; systems, helping those organizations fix security flaws before black hat hackers can exploit them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gray Hat Hacking</strong></h3>



<p>Gray hat hackers operate in a morally ambiguous space, blending both ethical and unethical hacking practices. They may discover vulnerabilities without authorization but later disclose them to the affected organization, sometimes in exchange for rewards. </p>



<p>In 2017, a gray hat hacker discovered a security flaw in the popular video game Overwatch. They reported it to Blizzard Entertainment and received in-game credits as a reward for their efforts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hacktivism</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hacktivism-1200x675.webp" alt="Hacktivism" class="wp-image-30576" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hacktivism-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hacktivism-300x169.webp 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hacktivism-768x432.webp 768w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hacktivism-150x84.webp 150w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hacktivism.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>Hacktivists are hackers who engage in cyber activities to promote political or social causes. While their intentions may be rooted in activism, their methods often involve hacking, defacing websites, or exposing sensitive information. The hacktivist group Anonymous is well-known for its actions in support of various causes. They&#8217;ve targeted websites, governments, and organizations to draw attention to issues like censorship, corruption, and human rights violations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Script Kiddies</strong></h3>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What is Ethical Hacking?</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term hacking might lead you to think that it is something <strong>illegal</strong>, something which is not supposed to be done, unauthorized, and so on. Although that seems fair, allow us to look at another side of the coin as ethical hacking involves White Hat hackers trained to test a system&#8217;s integrity &amp; find all the flaws that could lead to a <strong>potential security breach.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><b>&#8220;Ethical hacking is a part of cybersecurity and can be defined as the process of testing the system against all possible security breaches and solving any vulnerabilities in the system before any malicious attack even happens.&#8221;</b></p>
</blockquote>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hacking is illegal but ethical hacking is the <strong>authorized practice of bypassing system security</strong> to identify any potential data threat. Ethical hackers try to examine the systems to pinpoint the weak points in that system that malicious hackers can exploit. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethical hackers are also referred to as <strong>White hat hackers </strong>as their work involves the same as Black Hat hackers but ethical hackers don&#8217;t intend to harm anyone through their actions but only protect their systems and test the company&#8217;s security methodologies.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that your website or application contains sensitive data about your customers, malicious hackers can misuse this data for wrongful purposes. So you will need an ethical hacker to prevent any such malicious attacks from even happening and if it happens then the ethical hacker will perform the necessary action required to stop the Attack.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why is Cybersecurity important</strong></span><strong>?</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity is important for several reasons. First and Foremost it&#8217;s essential for protecting businesses from cyber attacks. These attacks can involve anything from stolen data to crippling systems that impact the entire business. Cyber security is also important for safeguarding personal information as well as protecting critical infrastructures like the power grid or the financial system.</span></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Secondly, Cybersecurity protects companies from legal liability. If a company is hacked and data is stolen the law often holds the company responsible even if the hackers were not actually from that company. Cyber security also helps protect companies against lawsuits related to environmental damage or product defects.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Cybersecurity protects companies against government investigations and accusations of wrongdoing by ensuring that their systems are properly protected against hacking and data breaches companies can avoid embarrassment and potential legal problems down the road</span>.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look around today, you will witness that we are more reliant on technology and devices than ever before. Benefits of this trend range from getting rid of Yellowbook, and having near-instant access to information on the internet </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o the modern conveniences provided by smart home automation technology and concepts like IoT devices.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many great things coming from technology, it&#8217;s highly likely that some potential threats lurk behind every device &amp; platform. Despite the world&#8217;s optimistic perception of modern devices, cyber threats possess an inevitable danger.&nbsp;</span></p>





<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What is Cybersecurity?&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more and more daily business activities moving online, it is becoming increasingly important for companies to ensure that no one is attempting to steal their data or money. According to <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-damages-6-trillion-by-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cybercrime Magazine</a>, cybercrime will cost the world $10.5 trillion annually by 2025!</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why cybersecurity plays a significant role in business. Cybersecurity involves the protection of computer-based equipment and information from unintended or unauthorized access change or destruction.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a process or state of protecting as well as recovering computer systems, devices, networks, and programs from any form of cyber attacks&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>5 Reasons Why Cybersecurity Is So Important</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity is important to every organization, no matter how big or how small.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>1. Cybercrime is on the Rise.&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are roughly 4,000 cyberattacks every day. One reason why the rate of cybercrime continues to increase is that it&#8217;s cheap, fast, and highly profitable compared to other types of crime, which is why that&#8217;s where cybercriminals are headed.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>2. Damage is Significant.&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybercrime can cost organizations Millions of dollars in damages. But it&#8217;s just about financial costs. It can also damage their reputation, and their ability to do business, and sometimes even compromise the health of employees, patients, customers, and others.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>3. Cybersecurity builds trust.&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity affects trust with customers and employees. When people don&#8217;t feel that their information is properly secured and kept private, they begin to lose trust in the brand, the product, and the services.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>4. Our Identities protect our data&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User Identities now protect billions of points of data. This is the Data that we&#8217;re transmitting at work, Data from IoT devices like a coffeemaker or the printers we use, and our personal information, as more of our data is becoming digitized. Securing these identities helps to reduce the risk of cybercrime to organizations, and to individuals alike.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>5. Every Organization has vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As organizations evolve merge and grow over time, their networks and systems naturally get more complicated and things may slip through the cracks.&nbsp; Additionally, end users like you and me can often be the weakest link in an organization&#8217;s security, and that requires these organizations to put robust security and compliance protections in place.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should all care about cyber security, it&#8217;s part of all of our jobs because it&#8217;s an essential part of every organization and when properly implemented a proper security approach can help us maintain a more secure private, and efficient work environment.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What is a Cyberattack?&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/types-of-cybersecurity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cyber attack</a> takes several forms including theft or unauthorized access to computers laptops tablets or mobile devices,&nbsp; a remote attack on IT systems or websites attacks,&nbsp; or the information held in third-party systems such as cloud devices.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a cyber attack strikes, it can result in financial losses, increased costs of recovery and replacement, damage to reputation, and damage to other dependent or connected companies.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six main types of cyber attacks have been identified. These are:&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Denial of service</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such an attack successfully prevents the authorized functionality of network systems or applications by exhausting resources. Once your system is attacked in this manner the hackers normally ask for our ransom or fee to regain access to files.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Malware worms and Trojan horses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These attacks are deadly viruses that are spread by emails, instant messaging, malicious websites, and affected non-malicious websites</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Botnets and Zombies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A &#8220;botnet&#8221; short for robot Network is an aggregation of compromised computers that are connected to a central controller. Compromised computers are often referred to as zombies. Botnets which are designed to steal data improve their encryption capabilities and thus become more difficult to detect.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Scareware&nbsp;</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;More commonly understood as fake security warnings. This type of attack can be particularly profitable for cyber criminals as many users believe the following warnings that tell that &#8211; &#8220;their system is infected or compromised&#8221; and then are tricked into downloading and paying for special software to protect their systems.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Man-in-the-middle </strong></h3>



<p>The type of cyber attack includes intercepting conversations or data transmissions between one or multiple people. An example would be using an unsecured Wi-Fi network to intercept the data that the victim transmits from their system to the network. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">SQL Injection</h3>



<p>SQL is short for Standard Query Language. An SQL injection aims towards performing certain actions on Data in a database and potentially corrupting or stealing it. It also includes inserting malicious code via SQL statements and taking advantage of data-driven vulnerabilities. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we can do to curb Cyberattacks? </h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very important for companies to protect themselves from the threat of scams, data thefts, and other online vulnerabilities. This can be done by:&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Planning</strong></span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–What information assets are critical to your business?&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–What kind of risks can they be exposed to?&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–What legal and compliance requirements are your business subject to?&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Implementing&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–Have you put in place the right security controls to protect your equipment, and information IT system, and outsource IT services?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–Does your staff know what their responsibilities are if you are attacked or something goes wrong?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–How will you deal with it and get back to business?</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reviewing </strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–Are you reviewing and testing the effectiveness of your controls?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–Are you monitoring and acting on the information you receive from them?&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–Do you know what are the latest threats?&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By asking and answering these and related questions businesses can better mitigate cyber-attacks and prepare effective cybersecurity measures.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the growing Cybersecurity Challenges? </h2>



<p>Now that you have an idea of what is cybersecurity, Let&#8217;s just suggest that there is a litany of issues &amp; challenges facing our digital ecosystem when it comes to cybersecurity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sheer Volume of Data to safeguard&nbsp;</h3>



<p>First and foremost is the sheer volume of digital assets that we collect, produce, distribute, share, and manage. Many of those assets have extraordinary value to individuals, governments, and organizations.&nbsp; The sheer volume of intellectual property that we produce, it&#8217;s not just valuable to those In corporate, clearly, but also to nation-state actors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Workforce Dependency&nbsp;</h3>



<p>There are so many bad actor attacks and the threat environment that&#8217;s out there, the security operation teams at top organizations are always occupied because they&#8217;re just continually being subject to attack and ensuring that we&#8217;re staying on track with security compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Black Market Tools</h3>



<p>The ongoing threat landscape is growing more complex. Threat actors can actually buy attack kits on the black market for pennies on the dollar and do extraordinary damage.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Weaponization of Social Media</h3>



<p>The hackers and bad actors have shifted from wanting that kind of information to sell for identity theft and they&#8217;ve shifted to a more nefarious kind of role like the Weaponization of social media in 2016 to rig and manipulate elections.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Security Risks Concerning IoT Devices</h3>



<p>Internet of Things devices are great, but they are really pushing the barrier far more toward convenience over security. When the Internet of Things devices are used by individuals who cannot or won&#8217;t patch and apply security updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In many cases, a lot of the vendors don&#8217;t make them available to consumers just because the device is so inexpensive in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So those devices are on the Internet for convenience purposes and people who want to control their electric lights or have an electronic doorbell probably don&#8217;t know that these devices are outside of administrative control and we don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing on our network. So we can mitigate that risk only to a certain extent, but they can also be leveraged for distributed denial of service attacks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Shortage of Vetted Cyber professionals&nbsp;</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s growing increasingly more difficult to hire security professionals to get them properly trained, to retain them in our environment. When you compare the need for really qualified people with the threat landscape, organizations have a very complex task to work with. That&#8217;s why companies are constantly looking for proficient network and security professionals who can assess and mitigate threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you wanna get started with Cybersecurity, pick this holistic <a href="https://www.guvi.in/courses/network-and-security/cyber-security-ethical-hacking-beginners/">self-paced course</a> to get your fundamentals clear. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Password Reuse</h3>



<p>Additional security threats for everyone on social media include password reuse, You may choose a really strong password, but if you are reusing it on 10 sites &amp; if it&#8217;s breached on one site, Hackers can use it on all the other nine and that&#8217;s a huge issue.</p>



<p>Organizations need to uphold security awareness education pieces and have their employees and users understand why they need better passwords to prevent these kinds of attacks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cloud Vulnerabilities&nbsp;</h3>



<p>From a technical perspective, moving to the cloud has enabled a lot of optimization of resources in almost every sector. On the other hand, if you don&#8217;t do it smartly, we&#8217;re all gonna suffer some massive breaches at the end of it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity refers to the protection of devices, processes, infrastructure, and assets of the organization from cyberattacks, data theft, breaches, unauthorized access, etc. With the advent of technology and the increasing interconnectedness of organizational systems and networks, effective cybersecurity management and strategy are necessary for organizations of all sizes and types accordingly. Investments are flowing into this field and the market is projected to be a staggering 403 billion US dollars by 2027. This in turn has led to a spurt in demand for experts in the field of cyber security. Cybersecurity is an umbrella term that encompasses different types of security. In this article, we&#8217;re trying to deconstruct various types of cybersecurity. So let&#8217;s dig in.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Application Security&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application security constitutes the measures and countermeasures meant to tackle threats and vulnerabilities that arise in the development stage of an application such as design application, development, deployment, maintenance, upgrade, etc. It mainly refers to the measure implemented in order to prevent the app&#8217;s code or data from being stolen or hijacked. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are various hardware, software, and procedures deployed to detect as well as mitigate security flaws in the application development process. Since 2007, OWASP (The Open Web Application Security Project ) has tracked and classified 10 critical threats to web application development such as injection, broken authentication, cross-site scripting, misconfiguration, and more.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the techniques to mitigate these attacks include input parameters, validation sessions, management, user authentication, authorization, etc. Application security also prevents bot attacks and ensures to stop any malicious interaction with the application and its APIs. The ultimate goal is to make sure that apps remain protected even as DevOps releases new content. </span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Information security</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information security refers to the protection of information and data from theft, unauthorized access breaches, etc. primarily to uphold user privacy and prevent identity theft.&nbsp;</span>Information security is evolving as one of the major requirements in businesses worldwide today.</p>



<p>Data is one of the major assets of the Digital Economy,&nbsp; so naturally, the protection of data is very very important. Starting from big corporate companies to small startups all have started investing in information security.</p>



<p>There are three basic principles of information security, also referred to as the CIA. </p>



<ol>
<li>Confidentiality&nbsp;</li>



<li>Integrity</li>



<li>Availability</li>
</ol>



<p>Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is not accessed by unauthorized parties. Integrity ensures that the information is not modified by accident or compromised for any reason. If it is modified by accident it should be recovered at any cost. The third one availability ensures that the information is highly available on a regular basis. Businesses prefer&nbsp; &amp; rely on the high availability of information always.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Now let&#8217;s look at the need for Information Security</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Protect the functionality of the organization:</strong> Each and every organization has a set of policies to follow, and each and every employee needs to abide by these rules and function in the organization.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Ensure the safe operation of the application: </strong>Every organization has various applications. These applications need to be secured safely, so the organization needs to create a safe environment to handle these applications.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Protect the data collected by the organization</strong> Companies collect various data from different clients. All this data is very confidential, so protecting this data is very important</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Disaster Recovery&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disaster recovery involves planning and strategizing to enable organizations to recover from cyber security / IT disasters.&nbsp; The type of cybersecurity includes risk assessment, analysis, prioritizing, and establishing disaster response and recovery mechanisms in place this enables organizations to recover faster from disasters and minimize losses.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Network Security</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Network security is a broad concept encompassing a wide range of technologies, processes, and devices. In simple terms, it constitutes monitoring and preventing authorized access and exploitation of the internal networks of an organization by leveraging both hardware and software technologies. Today&#8217;s network environment is complex, with a constantly changing threat environment and hackers looking to expose vulnerabilities. </span>This is one of the biggest types of cybersecurity that offers great job opportunities across all sectors and organizations. </p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These vulnerabilities and flaws can exist in various forms such as data, devices, users, applications, and location. As a result many organizations now implement security management tools and applications to combat these threats, exploits, and regulatory noncompliance. These safety nets are eminent when a few minutes of downtime can lead to widespread disruption and massive damage to an organization&#8217;s operations and revenues. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are various layers It ensures that internal networks are safe reliable and usable antivirus and anti-spyware software, VPN, IPS, firewall, etc. are used to prevent cyber threats from facing the organization. </span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Common Examples of Network Security Implementation</h3>



<ul>
<li>New passwords </li>



<li>Extra Login </li>



<li>Antivirus Program</li>



<li>Antispyware Software</li>



<li>Monitored Internet Access</li>



<li>Firewalls </li>



<li>Encryption </li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Website Security&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like the name suggests Website security is used to prevent and protect websites from cyber security risks on the Internet. The holistic website security programs will cover the websites, databases, applications, source codes, and files.&nbsp; There has been a steady rise in the number of data breaches on websites in the past few years resulting in identity thefts, downtime financial losses, loss of reputation and brand image, etc.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The main reason for this has been the misconception among website owners that their website is protected by a website hosting provider thus leaving them vulnerable to cyber-attacks.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size"><a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/cybersecurity-certifications/" data-type="post" data-id="3086">5 biggest Cybersecurity Certifications to advance your career in an evergrowing Cybersecurity Niche</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Endpoint Security&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endpoint security enables organizations to protect their servers, workstations, and mobile devices from remote and local cyber attacks since devices on a network are interconnected. </span>Primarily used to assess all the entry points for threats and vulnerabilities. It effectively secures the network by blocking all the attempts made to access these entry points via monitoring, file integrity, antivirus and anti-malware software, etc. </p>



<p>Also known as the zero-trust security model, endpoint security believes in creating micro-segments around data wherever it may be. By implementing endpoint security, companies can secure end-user services such as laptops and desktops with network and data security controls.  They can also advance their threat protection using anti-ransomware and anti-phishing. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cloud Security&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Cloud Security is a subset of cybersecurity that focuses on ensuring protection for cloud computing systems. It includes maintaining Security and data privacy online spanning applications, infrastructure, and platforms. Cloud providers like AWS or AZURE work together with their clientele, whether individuals, from SMEs to big enterprises to prevent the attack by exposing cloud vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As organizations rapidly transition to cloud computing, securing the cloud becomes a major priority for companies. An adequate cloud security strategy includes cybersecurity solutions, policies, controls, and services that assist in preserving an organization&#8217;s entire cloud deployment. ( Data, Application, infrastructure, etc) against attacks. </span></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1gP3iGEl2-7dZKzo92YFiIA.jpeg" alt="cloud security" class="wp-image-14853" style="width:600px;height:400px" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1gP3iGEl2-7dZKzo92YFiIA.jpeg 1200w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1gP3iGEl2-7dZKzo92YFiIA-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1gP3iGEl2-7dZKzo92YFiIA-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1gP3iGEl2-7dZKzo92YFiIA-150x100.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most of the cloud hosting companies offer security solutions, they often fail to expectations of enterprise-level grade security in the cloud. That&#8217;s why supplementary third-party organizations are required to protect against targeted attacks and data breaches in the cloud environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>Moreover, there is a myth about cloud computing and servers, that it&#8217;s less secure than traditional approaches. However, a <a href="https://www.alertlogic.com/assets/industry-reports/Cloud-Security-Spotlight-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2018 study by Alert&#8217;s </a>Logic Cloud Security discovered that on-premise storage users suffer more cyberattack events than those in a service provider environment. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Internet of Things </h2>



<p>The Internet of Things or short &#8220;IoT&#8221; is connecting billions of devices over the Internet to share data with each other. They are embedded with sensors and other software. IoT has made our lives much easier, for instance, we can turn off the light or switch on the air conditioner at home sitting far away from the office.</p>



<p>Internet of Things security is the process of protecting IoT devices from vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>IoT is becoming bigger and bigger day by day by 2025 there will be 41.6 billion IoT devices. Since billions of devices are connected over the internet to share data with each other even if one device is hacked the entire network is at risk. So securing the Internet of things has become a major concern. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Different threats in IoT security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong>MITM: </strong>MITM or man in the middle<b> </b>is a security breach where cyber criminals are placed between a communication system of a client and the server. This is by far the sneakiest attack by criminals. Vulnerable Wi-Fi connections and communication lines are the easiest methods to carry out this security breach.</p>



<p><strong>Identity and data theft: </strong>Hackers might attack IoT devices to gain sensitive information to carry out criminal activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>APT: </strong> Advanced persistent threats or apt occur when the attackers gain unauthorized access to a system or a network and remain undetected for a long duration of time. Mostly sponsored by nations or very large organizations. <br>Denial of service: A Dos attack occurs when the system receives traffic beyond the threshold to congest the server. This attack damages the reputation of an organization. Dos attackers usually attack the web servers of very large organizations such as media companies, government companies, and banking sectors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Summing up the list of types of cybersecurity</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many people ask how important is coding for cybersecurity, and the lawyerly answer is: Well, it depends on many facets.&nbsp;Because just starting off, many roles don’t really require you to code and based on how advanced you want to get, programming may or may not be all that important for you.</p>



<p>In this blog, we cover the relationships between cyber security tooling and expertise, and some on-the-job scenarios where it&#8217;s beneficial knowing how to code. and ending with some advice for all the non-programmers out there who are just starting out. So without further ado, Let’s break it down!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How crucial is coding for Cybersecurity? </h2>



<p>So how crucial is coding for cybersecurity? Think about it this way. Just about all the tools you use in cyber security are written in code, and programming lets you write tools. So the important questions to answer first are: what are tools? and what’s the value in knowing how to build them? On a conceptual level, tools extend your ability to change the environment around you, whether in the physical or digital world. Combined with intent, they let you create action and change. So the more advanced your tools are the more leverage you have. And with this leverage, you can have a wider range of actions and change. Archimedes once said:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-left has-background has-black-background-color is-style-solid-color has-white-color has-text-color"><blockquote><p><em>“Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand and I’ll move the Earth.”</em></p><cite>Archimedes</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>If he was standing in something more sophisticated like the Death Star, he’d also have the ability to blow it up; only if he knew how to operate it. Similarly. In the cyber world, it’s no different. Being able to get results in cyber depends on the types of software tooling at your disposal and your expertise in using them. So the first principle to keep in mind is that it’s the combination of tools and skills that will determine your overall cyber abilities, whether for an individual or for a team. So to improve your overall effectiveness, it’s important to make a balance between both.</p>



<p>Additionally, if you want to begin with Ethical Hacking &amp; Cybersecurity through a self-paced course, try <strong><a href="https://www.guvi.in/courses/network-and-security/cyber-security-ethical-hacking-beginners/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=coding-for-cybersecurity">GUVI’s Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking &#8211; Beginner course</a></strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Three Catagories of Cybersecurity: Blackbox users, tool operators, &amp; developers.</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s deconstruct them one by one. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blackbox Users</h3>



<p>Most BlackBox users will usually only know the basics of using one or a few different software systems, and only in situations that they’ve been trained in. These guys might even have a few certifications but aren’t able to apply their training to solve problems independently in more complex scenarios without the help or mentorship of more experienced practitioners. Being able to modify tools or craft new ones is out of the question.</p>



<p>The vast majority of people in cyber security would fall in this category. In General,  knowing how to code isn’t all that important for them, because they’ve yet to master many of the most common tools in the role, they’re already in. Whether it’s Wireshark, Metasploit, Autopsy, Burp Suite, Volatility, Cellebrite, Group Policy, et cetera. You’ll be much better off first focusing on fundamental principles like understanding computer networking, operating system architecture, and solving technical problems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tool Operators </h3>



<p>In the next category, we have tool operators who have years of experience in using a variety of software. And they can creatively chain them together in real-world scenarios. These guys are the backbone of companies’ IT and security firms and are often the workhorses responsible.</p>



<p>But for those without the ability to code, the downside is that when you’re in a situation without an immediately apparent tool available, there’s not much you can do about it.&nbsp;Taking the time to learn some programming can really amplify your ability at this stage. Since it lets you automate many of the tasks that you once performed manually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now tool developers, especially those who are actively involved in operations, can understand the ins and outs of the tools they use. Knowing how to program lets you modify existing software or craft something more custom to solve specialized cyber security problems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Operator Developers </h3>



<p>The operator-developer types tend to be some of the best cyber practitioners you’ll meet in the field and are hard to come by, depending on the team you’re on. In terms of overall ability, you’ll find that people who can chain tools together or write custom-built code have increasing levels of expertise that are orders of magnitude higher. And those with programming backgrounds tend to progress faster and deeper in their learning journeys than those who don’t.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let&#8217;s dwell on a real case study</h2>



<p>Here’s a case study from someone with years in Cybersecurity in his own words</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flex wp-container-4 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:100%">
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>&#8220;When I was first starting off in the field, I worked as a security analyst in a three-man team with no certifications and a very basic understanding of code. We were monitoring for malicious activity on the network using software called Splunk, which lets you build advanced queries to search across large datasets like network logs.</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>In many enterprise networks, the only traffic allowed to exit is common protocols like NTP, DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS, which is what you’d expect from internal users browsing the web or servers fetching updates. These services typically get hosted on ports 123, 53, 80, and 443. Firewalls would drop any other type of traffic destined for other ports to limit the risk of data exfiltration. To bypass this, malware will often hide their communication traffic within these common protocols as covert channels to evade detection. I pushed the idea of monitoring DNS traffic for signs of malicious activity, after reading about the technique in some academic white papers.</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Process</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>I wanted to develop a way to assign DNS queries in our logs weighted risk scores depending on the number of subdomains, the length, and the overall entropy of the query. Because I didn’t know how to code, I had to chain together an incredibly massive Splunk query to calculate everything. Even though this method worked and discovered outbreaks on the network, it was pretty slow and bogged down the system.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>So I had to rely on one of the other more senior guys on the team to re-implement my solution as a module in Python to do the same thing, but more efficiently. </em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>On one hand, my curiosity and persistence made me a valuable member of the team. But at the same time, had I learned the most basic programming skills, it would have given me the flexibility to describe the outcome of what I wanted to do using the language of code.&#8221;</em></p>
</div>
</div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>This experience later prompted the cybersecurity expert to act and take coding more seriously to patch up his skill gap. </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="598" src="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/n22XLfd.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-10111" srcset="https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/n22XLfd.jpeg 1200w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/n22XLfd-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://www.guvi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/n22XLfd-768x383.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who plays a larger role in Cybersecurity? Scripting or Programming Languages, and what should you learn? </h2>



<p>One caveat we do want to make is that it&#8217;s important to draw the line between scripting and software development. However many people will use the word “programming” or “coding” interchangeably to describe both of them. However, Scripting normally refers to writing short snippets of code in an interpreted language to automate tasks or glue the functionality of other tools together. Meanwhile, Software development is a broader term that covers scripting but also involves writing algorithms or libraries as part of a larger, more complex toolchain.</p>



<p>People often consider Python or Bash as scripting languages. While compiled ones like C++ or Java are more geared towards software development. Yet generally, it depends on the complexity of the tool and your intent. Whether you are looking for something quick and dirty or something more robust and enduring.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Operator Vs Developer Axis</h3>



<p>Now on the operator versus developer axis, you’re going to see a lot more scripts closer to the operator side. Whereas more compiled languages on the developer side. This isn’t true across the board, since people can bounce around the spectrum, but it’s a decent rule of thumb.</p>



<p>Since on the operator side of the spectrum, your focus is primarily on the pre-built tools with some degree of customized automation. In this case, it’s not massively critical to have a coding background, most computer science programs are much more heavily focused on topics like applied math, programming theory, and software development at the academic level. We personally suggest it’s better to start off learning scripting. As it&#8217;s quick to pick up and a bit more pragmatic for day-to-day technical tasks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Cybersecurity </strong>is an exponentially growing industry that is evolving to protect individuals &amp; organizations from increasing cyber-attacks. Recently, The <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>(AI) Industry is playing a vital role in cybersecurity, improving the efficiency of various organizations &amp; industries’ cybersecurity.</p>



<p>In the present-day scenario, AI &amp; ML algorithms are heavily in use to automate tasks/processes, crunch data, enhance cybersecurity, &amp; make decisions at a mind-blowing rapid speed. Now, anyone will arrive at a wondering state that AI might replace the cybersecurity industry. But, no! Surveys &amp; statistics show a different yet interesting story.</p>



<p>In the cybersecurity domain, It is imminent that AI will become indispensable to handle the threats. Also, the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in the market is expected to grow 23.6% from 2020 to 2027, predicting a reach of $46.3 billion by the end. However, the adoption of AI into cybersecurity isn’t risk-free. About 60% of the companies that imbibed AI have encountered cybersecurity risks generated by Artificial Intelligence. Here, in this case, to handle the cyber threats, the expertise of cyber warriors will again be the need of the hour. Clearly, we see that Cybersecurity &amp; AI make a mutual impact on each other, but that doesn’t actually diminish the opportunities in both domains.</p>



<p>Now, we can discuss another perspective here so that you’d understand the relationship between cybersecurity, artificial intelligence &amp; human intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Does Cybersecurity still have a dependency on Human Intelligence?</strong></h2>



<p>Though AI appears to do everything, it can’t do everything. Both Human Intelligence and artificial intelligence are two different sectors when it comes to performance in calculations. In general, human intelligence isn’t capable of performing a large number of calculations steadfastly. But, we race ahead by compensating in other aspects. Say, the features to explore, hypothesize, deduce, predict &amp; the ability to logically reason. Even under certain situations with inadequate data &amp; ambiguity, we could perform cognitive tasks in a better way than AI. Thus, our brains are the best simulators &amp; win with complex biological features over any fastest &amp; latest supercomputer.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity professionals have a logically reasoned &amp; intuitive approach to handling cyber threats. With a lot of anonymity &amp; ambiguity thrown by the cyber attackers, cyber experts evaluate the risks, make cognitive judgments &amp; make better decisions with human intelligence. Such human capabilities cannot be replicated by the currently evolved AI features.</p>



<p>As of now,&nbsp; AI technologies are capable of performing mathematical calculations at an exponential pace as compared to the human brain. Hence, this is the ultimate benefit for the cybersecurity domain where AI can augment the human brain to help bring solutions to cyber threats.</p>



<p><strong>Ultimately, we can come to a conclusion. With the growing cybercrimes, cyber threats &amp; black hacking</strong></p>



<p>If the question is about choosing a career, the focus should be on what kind of roles &amp; responsibilities the aspirant is interested in putting in an effort to become a professional.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are you someone who is interested in Cybersecurity &#8211;</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>Safeguarding the organization&#8217;s information systems &amp; its assets.</li>



<li>Identifying &amp; solving actual &amp; potential cyber threats.</li>



<li>Enjoys defining the access privileges, control structures, &amp; resource security.</li>



<li>Keeping the team &amp; users informed about threats or attacks by preparing performance reports &amp; communicating system status.</li>



<li>Debugging the security violations &amp; inefficiencies through frequent audits.</li>
</ul>



<p>(or)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are you someone who is interested in Artificial Intelligence &#8211;</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>Automating infrastructure for the <a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/best-data-science-courses-for-beginners/">Data Science</a> team</li>



<li>Coordinating between Business Analysts &amp; Data Scientists</li>



<li>Improving Machine Learning algorithms time-to-time</li>



<li>Test &amp; deploy Machine Learning models for meeting the business goals</li>



<li>Develop the most consumable products for users based on machine learning</li>



<li>Coordinating with multiple teams, both internally and externally</li>



<li>Boosting the process of statistical analysis &amp; interpreting the results for effective decision-making.</li>



<li>Making ML an integral part of website layouts, &amp; UX team to help deliver finished website layouts, further used by the s/w development team.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, making an informed decision is up to the aspirant. If improving business goals through AI automation skills then Artificial Intelligence is the one interesting career path for you. On the other hand, If cyber challenges &amp; ethical hacking skills fancy you towards an adventurous career then Cybersecurity is the right choice for you! And, this domain doesn’t necessarily require majors/degrees in the respective cybersecurity domain. Any beginner can start from scratch to learn the white-Hat warrior skills.

<p>There is something fascinating about a lone hacker in black hoodies using a single system and their skills to take down big corporations and their crony capitalism. The anecdote of a hacker has cultivated an ethos of individuality, corporate freedom, and distinct craftiness that can&#8217;t be denied. Also, the same archetype is visible in a number of pop-cultural references whether the famous TV series- Mr. Robot or real-life adaptations of Snowden and Julian Assange. Despite all the fascination of hacking, and hysteria, the field of cybersecurity is largely misunderstood outside of the realm of the IT ecosystem.</p>



<p>On the other hand, organizations/individuals face a series of cyberattacks such as Phishing, malware, DDOS, Man-in-the-middle, SQL injection, Zero-day exploits, DNS tunneling, and many others. Most of these crimes are usually financially motivated.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There are two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those who don’t yet know they have been hacked.</p>
<cite><strong>JOHN CHAMBERS, FORMAR CISCO CEO</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>According to a 2015 report from Cybersecurity Venture, these damages are speculated to reach around 6 Trillion by 2021. Ergo the growing demand for Cybersecurity prevention and professionals. The postings for cybersecurity professionals have grown 3X faster than other IT positions and roughly 12X faster than other professions. So, if you are looking to advance your career in <a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/why-should-you-learn-cyber-security/">Cybersecurity</a>, this blog will try to outline all the Must-have Cybersecurity certifications and their basic requirements, cost, and other technicalities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. CCNP Security: Cisco Certified Network Professional Security</h2>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Fee:$1200</span></strong></code></pre>



<p>Although<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/professional/ccnp-security-v2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> CISCO</a> offers a curated pathway to start from entry-level knowledge to get proficient in the cybersecurity profession. However, we recommend you go with CCNP Security certification. The particular security certification program will prepare you for today&#8217;s professional-level positions in system security. It validates the core knowledge you require while offering the flexibility to pick a focus area.</p>



<p>To Earn a CCNP Security, one needs to pass two exams: one defines the core competency. While the other is a concentration exam of your choice.</p>



<ul>
<li>The core exam, <strong>Implementing and Operating Cisco Security Core Technologies&nbsp;</strong>v1.0, aims at your expertise and skills in security infrastructure comprising cloud security, content security, network security, endpoint protection &amp; detection, visibility, secure network access, and enforcement.</li>



<li>On the other hand, the concentration exam aims at new breakthroughs as well as industry-specific topics such as identifying services, Cisco Firepower, email security, VPNs, web security, and automation. You need to pick one of the CCNP security concentration exam from:
<ul>
<li><strong>Implementing and Configuring Cisco Identity Services Engine</strong>&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Securing Email with Cisco Email Security Appliance</strong>&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Automating and Programming Cisco Security Solutions</strong>&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Securing the Web with Cisco Web Security Appliance</strong>&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Securing Networks with Cisco Firepower</strong>&nbsp;</li>



<li>And, <strong>Implementing Secure Solutions with Virtual Private Networks</strong>&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Completing both CCNP certification exams will earn you a Cisco® Specialist certification so that you will get accredited by an industry leader in the cybersecurity ecosystem.</p>



<p>Before moving into the next section, learn all of the Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking fundamentals from <strong><a href="https://www.guvi.in/courses/network-and-security/cyber-security-ethical-hacking-beginners/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=cybersecurity-certifications">GUVI&#8217;s Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking for Beginners</a></strong> and understand how to implement them with this beginner-friendly Cyber Security course along with Ethical Hacking.</p>



<p>Additionally, if you want to learn Ethical Hacking alone, enroll for <strong><a href="https://www.guvi.in/courses/network-and-security/ethical-hacking/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=cybersecurity-certifications">GUVI&#8217;s beginner-to-expert Ethical Hacking course</a></strong> and make your mark in the cybersecurity industry.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. CEH v11: Certified Ethical Hacker</h2>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Fee:$1,199(exam); $850 to $2,999 (training) and $99 (Add-ons)</span></strong></code></pre>



<p>In order to defend against malicious attacks, one first needs to learn how these security parameters are breached in the first place. That&#8217;s why <a href="https://www.eccouncil.org/train-certify/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certified Ethical Hacker CEH v11</a> aims to teach you all the modern commercial-grade hacking tools, methodologies, and techniques. Hackers and cybersecurity professionals explicitly use these methods to hack/firewall an organization. The CEH V11 cybersecurity certification is aligned rigorously to essential areas under NIST/NICE framework&#8217;s Protect and Defend (PR) job positions. It will help you advance your career as a federal employee for your respective country.</p>



<p>Here, the course aims to teach you 18 types of attack vectors. Most Importantly, the list includes OWASP Top 10, Vulnerability analysis, Fileless Malware, Webhooks, Web API Threats, IoT hacking, cloud attacks, AI, ML, and many others.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. CISA: Certified Information Systems Auditor</h2>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Fee:$760 (non-members); $575 (ISACA Members); $30 (ISACA Membership) </span></strong></code></pre>



<p>ISACA ( Information System Audit and Control System) issues a designation<a href="https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cisa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> CISA.</a> It is a global standard for professionals who wants to make a career in the information system. Above all, they are responsible for auditing, controlling, maintaining, and securing the company&#8217;s system architect. Becoming CISA is to get proficient in 5 Vital domains for any business. These domains are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Information System Auditing Process</li>



<li>Governance and Management of IT</li>



<li>Information System, Development, Acquisition, and Implementation.</li>



<li>Protection of Information Assets.</li>



<li>Information System Information and Business Resilience.</li>
</ul>



<p>The process to accredit yourself with CISA certification is simple. All you need to do is register yourself for the CISA exam and prepare for the same. Buying an ISACA membership will give you significant discounts over study aids. Although it&#8217;s not mandatory, one can take the CISA exam at their behest. Then the final step to getting CISA certified is to submit the CISA exam certification cleared within 5 Years. Then submit the full-time work experience in the CISA Job Practice Areas. Also, submit the CISA certification including the Application Processing Fee.</p>



<p>Again, just acquiring CISA certification isn&#8217;t enough. You need to maintain your cybersecurity certifications by earning continuing professional education credit hours. (CPE).</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. GIAC: Web Application Penetration Tester</h2>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color"><strong>FEE:$1,999</strong> </mark></code></pre>



<p><a href="https://www.giac.org/certifications/web-application-penetration-tester-gwapt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GIAC&#8217;s web application penetration tester</a> certification aims to validate a practitioner&#8217;s abilities to assess. And, monitor secure organization architecture through pen testing and a thorough understanding of web application security issues. GWAPT-accredited ethical hackers demonstrate sound pen testing methodologies and shed light on the following critical topics.</p>



<ul>
<li>Overview of authentication attacks, web applications, and configurable testings.</li>



<li>Cross-site scripting and forgery, reconnaissance and mapping, and client injection attacks.</li>



<li>Management of SQL injection attacks, web application sessions, and testing of tools.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. CISSP: Certified Information Systems Security Professional</h2>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color"><strong>FEE:$699; differs with specialisation </strong></mark></code></pre>



<p>Earning a<a href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> CISSP </a>will distinguish you from other job aspirants as it will prove to the recruiters that you have what it takes to effectively implement, design, and manage a best-in-class cybersecurity program. Similar to CISCO, the course offers a wide array of expertise and skills to become an experienced security practitioner, executive, architect, and auditor. However, it isn&#8217;t for everyone, if you are looking for a specific cybersecurity field of line, we suggest you go for CISCO. CISSP&#8217;s broad portfolio of accredited certifications include:</p>



<ul>
<li>IT/ICT Security Administration.</li>



<li>Security Assessment and Authorisation.</li>



<li>Secure Software development.</li>

<p>Cybersecurity is an exact solution that is sought either by a billionaire with a massive business or an innovator with a small start-up or even an individual who risks personal data online. Let&#8217;s see more.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover aligncenter is-light"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding="async" class="wp-block-cover__image-background" alt="" src="https://image.freepik.com/free-photo/programmer-typing-working-laptop-programming-about-cyber-security_42708-776.jpg" data-object-fit="cover"/><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow">

<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">“Security used to be an inconvenience sometimes, but now it is necessary all the time.”&nbsp; &#8211; Martina Navratilova</h4>



<p></p>



<p>This quote accurately articulates the importance and significance of privacy and data protection in the 21st century. From Twitter hacks of billionaires such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to everyday data breaches faced by companies and individuals. Cybersecurity has only proved to be more relevant as technology becomes more accessible, affordable, and advanced.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity, an essential field for today’s times, refers to securing digital infrastructure such as networks, systems, &amp; so on from attacks. When individuals and businesses practice &amp; enforce cybersecurity measures, they protect themselves and their assets on computerized systems from unauthorized access. Cybersecurity is not just for the rich and the successful, but also for those who share their data online to access basic services. Here are a few reasons why cybersecurity is super relevant today:</p>





<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a id="post-2848-_m9esgsqz0khk"></a>Cyber-attacks affect everyone</h2>



<p>Cyber attackers do not choose an entity based on the bank account of the individual or the firm. It can affect anyone, be it an ordinary individual or a big company. According to research conducted by Clark School at the University of Maryland, <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/87787-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hackers attack a computer every 39 seconds.</a> Cyberattacks affect big businesses and individuals who disclose their information and sensitive data over websites. This may not be secure or are vulnerable to hacking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a id="post-2848-_t5ms9d68b676"></a>Cybercrime damages to exceed $6 trillion by 2021</h2>



<p>Perhaps the most hard-hitting fact about cybercrime that validates the need for cybersecurity is the numbers associated with it. While cybercrime damages are predicted to exceed a staggering <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybersecurity-almanac-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6 trillion by 2021</a>, global spending on cybersecurity measures is projected to exceed $10 billion. This propels the need for cybersecurity in the digital age. Also, highlights its importance for everyone to protect themselves against these catastrophic losses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a id="post-2848-_29vnwvq0vo9l"></a>Incapacitation of organization</h2>



<p>Did you know that businesses face over 4,000 hacks using ransomware every day? Lack of proper cybersecurity can lead to the overall incapacitation of organizations, big and small.</p>



<p>Apart from these attacks from hackers, businesses can incur huge fines amounting to <a href="https://theect.org/importance-cyber-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than £122 billion</a> if they fail to adhere to data protection laws. This is what we say incapacitation of organizations, a process through which they get helpless and are unable to grow or carry out their day-to-day functions. Hence, organizations can go bankrupt from both ends, and this is why cybersecurity is imperative for them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a id="post-2848-_i2f2881smz3e"></a>What other Web threats can Cyber Security address?</h2>



<p>Cybercrimes are not limited to businesses and organizations. Every day, consumers on the internet can be victims of phishing schemes, data breaches, identity thefts, and financial losses. According to a <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20190806/internet-of-things/netscout-iot-devices-under-attack-within-minutes-of-turn-up#:~:text=Internet%20of%20Things%20devices%20are,new%20security%20report%20from%20Netscout." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netscout report</a>, it takes only 5 minutes for an internet-connected device to be hacked, be it a smartphone, an automobile computer, a smart TV, or a home control system. Therefore, cybersecurity involves safeguarding everything and everyone, everywhere.</p>
