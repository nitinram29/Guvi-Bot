<p>First, one should get a <a href="https://www.guvi.in/courses/web-3-0/blockchain/">general idea of what blockchain technology is all about</a>. Another intriguing question that one can ask is what a blockchain developer does.</p>



<p>The answers to these queries comprise understanding the basic concepts and acquiring the required skills. Additionally, it also includes the study of the applications of blockchain technology in the real world.</p>



<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The easy place to start would be the story of Bitcoin. The&nbsp;history of blockchain is closely linked with cryptocurrencies and tracing the journey. So, developments of Bitcoin can help you get an overview of both of these.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Programming Skills</h3>



<p>As for any other technology, one should have strong programming skills to get started with blockchain development. Object-oriented programming is essential. Additionally, one also needs a good knowledge of data structures and algorithms.</p>



<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">C++ is one of the most popular languages for blockchain development. Solidity is one of the fastest-growing blockchain programming languages.</span></strong> I<span data-preserver-spaces="true">t came into existence specifically for writing active contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.</span></p>



<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other blockchain programming languages include Vyper,</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;which we derive from <a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/best-websites-to-learn-python-for-free/">Python 3</a>;&nbsp; </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://go.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Golang (Go)</a></span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. It is considered the best for creating hyper-ledger fabric. </span>Simplicity <span data-preserver-spaces="true">is another high-level programming language that helps in creating smart contracts.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Understanding Core Concepts</h3>



<p>Likewise, anyone learning blockchain technology needs to properly understand the core blockchain concepts. These imbibe concepts like blocks, immutability, smart contracts, peers, nodes, and so on.</p>



<p>It also includes understanding data distribution, synchronization, and integrity. These concepts serve as the foundation for actually designing and working with blockchain technology.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Designing and Developing</h3>



<p>To begin with, build a good understanding of the significant concepts. Acquiring a good grip on programming skills will help you design blockchain protocols. In short, centralizing and decentralizing the data is done with the network architecture. Furthermore, this will help in developing and monitoring smart contracts.</p>



<p>It may also include <a href="https://www.guvi.in/blog/5-best-back-end-programming-languages/">backend technologies</a> according to the blockchain protocols and front-end development according to the client’s requirements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Domain Knowledge</h3>



<p>Procuring domain knowledge is essential for those who are planning to work in a specific industry. The scenario will be different for the new learners who want to get started with blockchain. They can study the real-world use cases and case studies to further dive deeper into this.</p>



<p>Even so, since cryptocurrencies and blockchain are so closely knit, you might even want to go through basic concepts of economics such as money and currency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Test Your Knowledge</h3>



<p>Once you have gone through all these steps, you might want to put your knowledge to the test. Quizzes are the best way to do so and building projects is even better. That said, taking up a project can be a great learning experience. This will grant you hands-on experience. Designing and developing blockchain protocols, writing active contracts, creating crypto wallets, etc., would then be handy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a id="post-2893-_3kas2h05haa"></a>Learning Blockchain Technology: Where Can You Get Started?</h2>



<p>For a new learner, some of these learning techniques might appear to be daunting.<br>But with hard work and dedication, anyone can become a blockchain developer.
